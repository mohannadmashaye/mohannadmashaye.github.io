            <p class = "paragraph first"> I worked as an IT intern at Carleton University’s Information Technology Services department for over a year. In this role, I was responsible for several tasks.
              Our department had recently received new phones and accessories. Thus, one of my main projects was updating multiple pages on Carleton’s Voice Services website.
            </p>
            <p class = "paragraph"> The website is WordPress based, however I mainly used HTML5 and CSS3 to update the pages to gain experience in web development. As I previously stated,
              I was tasked with updating information on Carleton phones, accessories, and pricing. These website updates are essential for faculty admins because they are responsible for
              ordering phones and accessories for staff members. Below is a list of updates I made on multiple pages:
            </p>

            <ul class ="paragraph webpages">
              <li class ="purple-bullets">Replaced old phones and accessories pictures, features, titles and pricing information</li>
              <li class ="purple-bullets">Added links to new Reference and User guides</li>
              <li class ="purple-bullets">Created new webpage for all discontinued phones and accessories</li>
              <li class ="purple-bullets">Rearranged layout of multiple webpages</li>
              <li class ="purple-bullets">Edited several images using Adobe Photoshop</li>
            </ul>

            <p class ="paragraph"> This project strengthened my HTML and CSS skills. I had to change and resize images, position elements, update text et cetera. Further, it was exciting because it was the first
              time I worked on a website used by <em>many</em> people. Once I was finished my updates, I felt proud knowing I had helped admins across the university obtain phones for Carleton employees a
              little easier. I have created a video outlining all the changes I made in detail:
